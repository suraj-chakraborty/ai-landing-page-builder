# AI Landing Page Builder

AI Landing Page Builder is a experiment, all ui-powered tool for generating customizable, production-ready landing pages using React, Next.js, and popular UI libraries like Tailwind CSS, Ant Design, Chakra UI, and Material UI. Simply describe your desired sections (e.g., "hero section", "features section", "form section", "footer section",future sections next) and the builder generates the code and assets for you.

## Features

- **AI-driven prompt parsing**: This is not really an ai driven app it is just an app to cover all logical posibility.
- **Supports multiple UI libraries**: Choose from Tailwind CSS, Ant Design, Chakra UI, Material UI, and more.
- **Live Preview**: Instantly preview your landing page as you build.
- **Downloadable Code**: Export your landing page as a ready-to-run Next.js project.
- **Customizable Sections**: Hero, Features, Form, Footer, and more.
- **Dark/Light Theme Support**: Switch between dark and light modes.
- **Modern Stack**: Built with Next.js 14, React 18, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.
